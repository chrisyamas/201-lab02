      <h2 id="bio">So who is this guy?</h2>
      <p>Christopher Yamas was born and raised in the Philly suburbs with an outgoing family: his father an entrepreneur in the hospitality industry, his mother an energy healer and yoga teacher with her own studio, and his brother an actor-turned-producer-turned-memoirist. Inspired by their ambitious and expansive natures, Christopher began volunteering with an international non-profit dedicated to supporting educational infrastructure in developing nations. His experiences with <a href="https://www.buildon.org/">buildOn</a> initiated what has become an enduring passion for travel and the nomadic lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Due to his mom's 'hippie' influence, he moved out to California shortly after high school graduation to study mindfulness-based psychology at a <a href="https://www.uwest.edu/">Buddhist university</a>. Soon after arriving on campus, however, his involvement in student government at that school solidified his interest in political change (initially sparked with his volunteer work in high school for the 2008 Obama campaign) dramatically shifted his educational and career trajectory.</p>
      
      <h2 id="edu">The yearn to learn</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The power of structural change was made evident to Christopher when he was (through a series of unlikely events) made interim-President of the student government during his freshman year.</li>
        <li>In this capacity, he inherited the beginnings of a process to formally incorporate the student-led institution as it's own 501(c)7 financial entity: independent from the university.</li>
        <li>While it may seem like a trivial (or rather boring) legal distinction, this new status allowed students to more efficiently access funds for their educational and extracurricular activities.</li>
        <li>Previously, a low-income student who applied for travel/lodging funds to attend a conference in their field of study often would be caught in bureaucratic red tape until long after the event date.</li>
        <li>A small legal change made a huge difference in the lives of thousands of students for years to come.</li>
        <li>Christopher was eager to learn how to make more positive impacts like this.</li>
        <li>The following year, he switched to a nearby community college that had a high transfer rate to competitive universities, and soon after transferred to UC Berkeley.</li>
        <li>There he was elected as the first transfer student Senator to serve in the ASUC in several years.</li>
        <li>He advocated for tranfer students, who often struggled to aclimate to campus and who tended to be from more diverse background and socioeconomic demographics.</li>
        <li>His particular passion project (pushing the university to build what would be its <b>first ever</b> on-campus housing dedicated to transfer students) actually <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/02/01/uc-berkeley-breaks-ground-on-helen-diller-anchor-house/">just started to come to fruition this week</a>!</li>
        <li>Christopher graduated from Berkeley in May 2019 with a Bachelor's in Economics and a hunger to continue advocating for big structural change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="job">The campaign trail</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After bugging everyone he knew with a connection to the campaign, Christopher landed a job with Elizabeth Warren's field operation in Nevada in June 2019.</li>
        <li>Given his experience organizing on college campus, he began a Campus Organizing Director in Las Vegas.</li>
        <li>While this wasn't his first electoral race (he had taken some time off from college to work as a campaign staffer on congressional races) it was definitely the most exciting one while it lasted.</li>
        <li>But with a bang and a fizzle, one week after Senator Warren withdrew from the race, COVID lockdowns began.</li>
        <li>Once campaigns began hiring again, Christopher joined the Kansas Democratic Party's operations as the Field Director for the 4th Congressional District race.</li>
        <li>This was his first experience working remotely, which he found to be his preference since remote work allows for both location flexibility and greater work-life balance.</li>
        <li>This fit well with his passions for travel and self-care (yoga mom, remember?) and he found he had more energy to perform even better at his duties.</li>
        <li>After the 2020 general election, Christopher was hired as Atlanta Field Director for the Good Deed Corps to increase voting access for marginalized communities (like formerly incarcerated and unhoused voters) leading up to the Jan 5, 2021 Georgia Special Election.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="goals">Goals for what lays ahead...</h2>
      <p>After taking 2021 to reflect, Christopher decided to train in software development skills. He believes a career in the tech sector will allow him to continue feeding his passions for travel and structural change, while also experiencing a career stability that was not easy to achieve in political campaign work. His specific goals for the short- and medium-term are:</p>
        <ul id="goalList">
          <li>Pushing himself to become the best software developer possible by excelling in Code Fellows' track and graduating from the Code 401 Python class that is scheduled to end on June 24<sup>th</sup>;</li>
          <li>Excelling in interviews and securing employment with an established company (not a start-up) where he can continue to rapidly grow in his skillset</li>
          <li>Continuing preparation to run a half-marathon this summer, as this daily athletic training helps maintain his physical and mental wellness</li>
          <li>Visiting the remaining 7 states needed for him to have been to all 50 U.S. states (ideally while he's 30 years old, so before September 16, 2023). The remaining states are Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and (funny enough, given his Seattle-based Code Fellows enrollment) Washington.</li>
